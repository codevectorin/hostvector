    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ</h1>

<h3>What is Shared Web hosting?</h3>

  <p>In Shared Web Hosting, multiple clients are hosted on a single server i.e. the clients share the server's resources. This helps reduce the cost, since the cost of the server and its resources are spread over all the clients/packages hosted on the server. Shared Hosting is perfect for personal websites, small and mid-sized businesses that do not require all the resources of a server.</p>

<h3>How do I get answers if I need help?</h3>

<h3>Is Email hosting included in my package?</h3>

<p>Yes, all our Hosting packages come with Unlimited Email Hosting.</p>

<h3>Can I host multiple Web sites within one Shared Hosting plan?</h3>

  <p>In no event shall HostVector or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on HostVector's website, even if HostVector or a HostVector authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

<h3>What is the PHP Version of the server?</h3>

  <p>We provide multiple php versions to our users.<br>
    PHP 5.5 <br>
    PHP 5.6 (default) <br>
    PHP 7.0 <br>
You can easily change the PHP Version by using the MultiPHP Manager in Cpanel (Cpanel > MultiPHP Manager). </p>
